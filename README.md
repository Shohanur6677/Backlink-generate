1. Scoring Top-Tier Links
Google ranks sites higher when they've got backlinks. By writing guest posts, you snag do-follow backlinks from sites with mega Domain Authority (DA) and Page Authority (PA). If a big-deal website throws a link your way, search engines get the hint that you're dishing out top-notch stuff so go up your rankings.
Best Ways to Rock at Backlinks:
Chase after sites packing a hefty DA (you want 50 or more, for real).
Pick backlinks that make sense and fit right in.
Don't go overboard with anchor text optimization; you don't wanna get busted with a penalty.
2. Uplevels Your Organic Traffic
Throw your guest articles on popular webpages, and watch how you pull more eyeballs over to your side. This kind of move spikes up the interaction, drops the rate people bounce off your page, and search engines end up liking you more.
